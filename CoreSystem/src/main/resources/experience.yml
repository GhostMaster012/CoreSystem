# Configuration for Core Experience Sources

# Experience gained from killing mobs
# You can specify XP per mob type, or use DEFAULT for any mob not listed.
mob-kills:
  # Specific mob XP values
  ZOMBIE: 5
  SKELETON: 5
  CREEPER: 10
  SPIDER: 4
  ENDERMAN: 15
  # Default XP for any other mob not listed above
  DEFAULT: 1

# Experience gained from killing other players
player-kill: 50

# Experience gained from feeding the core items
# This is a placeholder for now. A more complex system might involve a GUI
# and different XP values per item type.
# For now, this could be a flat rate if a /core feed command is implemented simply.
core-feed:
  # Example: Feeding a DIAMOND gives 100 XP
  # DIAMOND: 100
  # GOLD_INGOT: 20
  # This section is more for planning the /core feed GUI later.
  # For a simple command, we might just use a flat value or a specific item.
  DEFAULT_ITEM_SACRIFICE_XP: 5 # If a generic item is sacrificed via a simple command

# Experience from survival events (placeholders for now, API can be used by other plugins)
# e.g., time-survived, distance-travelled - these would require active tracking.
survival-events:
  # first-join-bonus: 100 # Example, not implemented in this step
  # play-time-hour: 10 # Example, grant 10 xp per hour of playtime

# Maximum level a core can reach (also in config.yml, ensure they are consistent or one takes precedence)
# This is more of a reference here; max-core-level in config.yml is the primary controller.
# max-level: 20
